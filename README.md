## Thinking Process
- First, I didn't know much about the video scrolling and what technology it used. But after searching in Google, ChatGPT, and learning from it, then I discovered it should have main components like the video should be in a 9:16 ratio for mobile phones, and the basics like title, description, like, share, play/pause, mute/unmute.
- Then I learned how to implement that the next video should be ready and while playing the current video, it should soon go on to the scrolling functionality.
- Other than this, the rest of the implementation was easy and a little bit helped by Google / AI.
